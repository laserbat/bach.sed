Bach's prelude in C major from WTC book I, written in sed

to listen to it run

$ echo | ./bach.sed | aplay -r44100

and give it a few seconds to produce audio.

You can add tee to the pipeline to see the square waves produced by sed

$ echo | ./bach.sed | tee >/dev/tty |aplay -r44100

Alternatively, you can listen to the mp3 in this repository or listen at https://clyp.it/fuz0ehy3
